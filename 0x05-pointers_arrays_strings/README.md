1. Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
2. Write a function that swaps the values of two integers
2. Write a function that returns the length of a string.
3. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
4. Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
5. Write a function that reverses a string.
6. Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7. Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
8.Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
You are allowed to use printf
9. Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

Return value: the pointer to dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcpy. Run man strcpy to learn more.
